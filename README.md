# AUDIOBOOK-TO-PDF-CONVERTOR
In this current busy routine people do not find time to
read a book, or to convert the PDF file into an MP3
player using third-party applications or web
applications. Even I have a directory at which I store
pdf books that I plan on reading, but I never do. So, I
thought hey, why do not I make them audiobooks and
listen to them while I do something else ! In this
system, we are developing a GUI application using
python to convert the PDF file into audio format and
read it out to the user. The application is more userfriendly as it does not require any audio file or MP3
player. The user will have to select the PDF file which
the user wants to listen to.


The problem Statement of this project is:
To create a PDF to Audiobook Converter using
different Tkinter and python files, functions, and
definitions. The main packages used in this audiobook
converter arepyttsx3 and PyPDF2. Pyttsx3 is a python
library for text to speech. This is the reason which
helps the machine to speak to us. This reads out the
selected PDF into audio in a suitable voice, speed of
reading with volume adjustments. This also contains a
notepad. Pyttsx3 extracts the text from the PDF. This
is a pure-python library built as a PDF toolkit [9]. This
can extract document information, split, and merge
documents page by page. This section(issues)
describes the drawback of the older versions of
audiobooks. To overcome the(issues) the project PDF
to Audio Converter has been developed to extract data
from the pdf selected by the user, and to extract the
data from the pdf, convert it to audio format to read
out loud.

PDF to Audio Converter is a GUI application
containing play, pause(buttons), and label to display
text which allows the user to select the PDF files and
the user has to click on the play button in order to
extract text from the PDF file and will read the text.
The application has been developed in a way that until
the speaker reads out the extracted text the player
cannot be paused. The GUI is also provided with a
label to display the text, the text will only be displayed
only after reading the extracted text.
With PDF being the most used document format
globally, there is a need to convert the text in PDF
formats into Audio signals. These can be utilized for
various purposes, e.g., in the educational system, car
navigation, announcements in railway stations,
response services in telecommunications, and email
reading. Furthermore, people with vision
disabilities cannot view or read PDF files and this is a
major setback. This research addresses the problems
in converting PDF text into speech. One is how to
improve the naturalness of synthetic speech in PDFbased text into an Audio system.
